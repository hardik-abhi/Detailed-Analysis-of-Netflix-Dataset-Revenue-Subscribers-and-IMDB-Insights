Detailed-Analysis-of-Netflix-Dataset-Revenue-Subscribers-and-IMDB-Insights

Objective:

The aim of this analysis is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset to uncover insights about revenue and subscriber counts from different countries, as well as trends from IMDB data. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we will visualize and interpret data to understand regional preferences, content popularity, and revenue drivers.

Dataset Overview:

The dataset comprises the following key components:

Netflix Revenue Data:

1. Revenue by Country

2. Subscriber Count by Country

3. Time Period: Yearly or Quarterly Trends

Content Data:

1. Titles, Genres, Release Year

2. IMDB Ratings and User Reviews

3. Duration (for movies) and Seasons (for TV shows)

Geographical Data:

1. Country Information

2. Regional Categorization (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific)

Steps for Analysis:

1. Data Preparation:

# Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values in columns such as IMDB ratings or revenue.

Normalize country names for consistency.

# Data Transformation:

Create additional columns for:

Revenue Per Subscriber = Revenue / Subscriber Count

Profit Margin (if cost data is available)

Aggregate data at various levels (yearly, by region).

# Data Merging:

Combine Netflix revenue/subscriber data with IMDB content data using titles or countries as keys.

2. Analysis with Pandas:

# Descriptive Statistics:

Summarize revenue and subscriber data by continent and country.

Identify top-performing genres and highest-rated titles.

# Data Aggregation:

Group data by year, region, or genre to identify trends.

Calculate metrics like average IMDB ratings by genre or region.

3. Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn:

# Revenue and Subscriber Trends:

Line plots showing yearly revenue and subscriber growth.

Bar charts comparing revenue and subscriber count by country.

# IMDB Ratings Analysis:

Box plots to analyze rating distribution by genre.

Scatter plots for correlation between IMDB ratings and revenue.

# Regional Performance:

Heatmaps to visualize revenue and subscriber density by region.

Stacked bar charts showing genre distribution by region.

Key Analysis Goals:

A. Revenue and Subscriber Analysis:

Identify countries contributing the most to Netflixâ€™s revenue and subscriber base.

Analyze growth trends over time in different regions.

Calculate and visualize the revenue-per-subscriber metric across countries.

B. IMDB Data Insights:

Highlight top-rated Netflix content based on IMDB ratings.

Analyze the popularity of genres in different countries and regions.

Correlate high IMDB ratings with revenue to identify content strategies.

C. Geographical and Demographic Insights:

Determine regional preferences for genres (e.g., comedy in North America vs. drama in Asia).

Identify untapped markets with lower revenue-per-subscriber values.

Deliverables:

1. Descriptive Report:

Summary of revenue and subscriber trends by country and region.

Insights on IMDB ratings and their correlation with content performance.

2. Visual Dashboards:

Revenue trends and heatmaps.

IMDB ratings analysis with box plots and scatter plots.

3. Recommendations:

Focus on genres and regions with the highest revenue growth potential.

Invest in content types with proven high IMDB ratings to maximize subscriber retention.

# Conclusion:

The EDA of Netflix datasets using Python reveals critical trends and patterns in revenue, subscribers, and content performance. These insights can guide strategic decisions in content production, marketing, and regional expansion to optimize growth.
